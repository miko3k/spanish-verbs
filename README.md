# Improved version of Fred Jehle's Conjugated Spanish Verb Database

PostgreSQL and CSV databases of 600+ conjugated Spanish verbs forming 11,000+ combinations of moods and tenses. Original work by Fred Jehle and database orignally compiled by @ghidinelli. 

This repository is a total convertsion into JSON format. It also fixes plenty of issues and adds some additional information from the original source. Also contains one file per verb.

The database is currently provided in JSON format only. I wouldn't be against an automated tool to convert it to different formats.

The original database has been incorporated into a number of tools including:

 * Conjug - a free practice tool by @dcomtois is online - http://es.conjug.com
 * es-api - a free web API for accessing the database by @lwm - https://github.com/lwm/es-api
 * conjugarden by @hghwng - https://github.com/hghwng/conjugarden
 * grammar-cards by @twcamper - https://github.com/twcamper/grammar-cards
